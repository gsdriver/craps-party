Basic flow
 - Launch the skill; prompt for permission for skill personalization if not enabled
 - Do a roll call
   - How many players?
   - For each player; say your name (allows association of personal id with name)
 - Start playing - say who the shooter will be
 - Everyone can say their bet at any time
   - If we have personlization, we will acknowledge
   - If not (in that request), we'll confirm who it is - we'll start with the name after the last person who said something
 - The shooter can say roll when they are ready to roll the dice
   - If there is no personalization, we'll just accept and roll
   - If there is personalization and it's not the shooter, we'll say who the shooter is and ask them to confirm
 - After each roll, you can place additional bets. We let them know this after the point is established
 - Again, same logic repeats for saying roll
