# Craps Party
Alexa skill that allows multiple players to play a game of craps with Echo Buttons.

Each player buzzes in using an Echo Button. After the roll call, players use the button to indicate when they want to make or remove a bet.  You can specify an amount for your bet `bet 5 dollars`. If no amount is specified,
then the last amount bet will be used, otherwise the table minimum will be used for your first bet.

After you've placed your line bets, you can say `roll` to roll the dice or the shooter can press their button twice.  After each roll you can place additional bets, or continue rolling until you hit your point or seven out.
