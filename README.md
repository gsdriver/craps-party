# Craps Party
Alexa skill that allows multiple players to play a game of craps. Uses skill personalization to differentiate between different players, allowing them to yell bets in any order.

Each says their name to register with the skill. After the roll call, players can say their bets. If using skill personalization, the skill will automatically detect who is talking. Otherwise, the skill will prompt for the name of the person who is placing a bet.  You can specify an amount for your bet `bet 5 dollars`. If no amount is specified,
then the last amount bet will be used, otherwise the table minimum will be used for your first bet.

After you've placed your line bets, you can say `roll` to roll the dice.  After each roll you can place additional bets, or continue rolling until you hit your point or seven out.
